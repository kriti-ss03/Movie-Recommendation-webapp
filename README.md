Thoughts behind the UI/UX:

I wanted the UI to be simple and eye soothing, since this was a movie-recommender-app which meant the user was going to be spending a lot of time in front of the screen. I designed it in dark theme and make each page connected to each other. Moreover, I tried to highlight things like Trending section, Anchor keys and button that give the user idea to understand the flow.I tried to see wheteher correct button is selcted or not by providing prompts and it's get focused if selected to let user know about the same. The main motto is that it's Fast, Smooth and give better user experience
